Web Engineering  

## Summary  
This repository was created to document the practical assignments for the Web Engineering (EW2025) class. Throughout the semester, I will develop various practical assignments (TPCs), applying the concepts and techniques learned in class to build complete web solutions using modern front-end and back-end technologies.  

Each TPC is in its own folder, containing the developed source code, necessary auxiliary files, and a `README.md` file that provides a detailed description of the work done.
